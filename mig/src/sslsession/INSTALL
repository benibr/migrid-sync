Module for extracting SSL session information from builtin python ssl

Tested with Python 2.7.5 and 3.6.8 on CentOS 7. Should work just as well on
other platforms.

Embeds data structures from Python source:
Modules/socketmodule.h
Modules/_ssl.c

Dependencies:
=============
C compiler (e.g. gcc), Python development headers, OpenSSL development headers
On Debian/Ubuntu: apt install build-essential python-dev openssl-dev
On RHEL/CentOS: yum install gcc python-devel openssl-devel

For platforms with multiple Python versions it may be necessary to install
the matching pythonN versions of the Python development headers, too. On CentOS
7 that would be the python3-devel package.


Install:
=================
In general one can install with
pip install .
but for version specific installs it would similarly be
pip2 install .
and
pip3 install .
respectively.

Uninstall:
=================
In general one can uninstall with
pip uninstall sslsession
but for version specific installs it would similarly be
pip2 uninstall sslsession
and
pip3 uninstall sslsession
respectively.
