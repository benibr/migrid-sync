This folder is included to have a place to optionally store any site-specific
secrets used in the migrid stack separately from the site configuration in
MiGserver.conf. As an example the user_imnotify_password, password_salt,
digest_salt and crypto_salt options there support reading the actual value from
a file instead of inlining the value directly in the configuration file.
Of course you should still be careful about restricting access if you choose to
store such secrets here.
For GDP sites one can choose to e.g. gocryptfs mount local or network storage
on top of this folder to make sure the contents remain encrypted at rest. That
also makes it easier to avoid secrets spilling in plain text to remote backup.
